# Turing-Machine-Emulator-
Visual Turing Machine Emulator (Visual Studio 2013 C #)

A simple emulator that allows you to: create, save and load, demonstrate simple algorithms. There are several sample examples in the program: move of letters, word duplication, increase by 1, multiplication by 2, translation from the unary system into decimal, adding unary numbers.

You can create your own algorithm and save it, for further demonstration!

Turing machines are the first devices to study algorithms. Read more about Turing Machine
